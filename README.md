AI-Enhanced Development Workflow Demo

This project demonstrates a structured, AI-enhanced development workflow applied to a real Python feature. The goal was to refactor an existing function to improve its modularity, readability, and error handling.

Project Structure

•
data.py: The original Python script containing the process_user_data function.

•
refactored_data.py: The refactored version of the script, adhering to improved design principles.

•
PROJECT_RULES.md: A markdown file outlining the development rules followed during refactoring.

•
diff.txt.git_diff.diff: A git diff output showing the changes between the original and refactored code.

•
workflow_summary.md: A detailed summary of the AI-enhanced development workflow in French.

Feature Chosen for Refactoring

The process_user_data function in data.py was selected for refactoring. This function was responsible for loading JSON data, filtering active users, and extracting their names. It was identified as a good candidate due to its monolithic structure and potential for improved error handling and modularity.

AI-Assisted Planning (Simulated)

During the planning phase, the following architectural decisions were made:

•
Modularization: Break down process_user_data into smaller, single-responsibility functions:

•
load_json_data(file_path): To handle JSON file loading.

•
filter_active_users(users_data): To filter users based on their active status.

•
extract_user_names(users): To extract names from a list of user dictionaries.



•
Error Handling: Enhance error management for FileNotFoundError and json.JSONDecodeError.

•
Readability: Incorporate list comprehensions and type hints for clearer, more Pythonic code.

Project Rules

The PROJECT_RULES.md file guided the development process with the following principles:

1.
Modularity: Each function must have a single responsibility.

2.
Error Handling: Handle exceptions appropriately and provide clear error messages.

3.
Readability: Use list comprehensions and other Python idioms for concise and readable code.

4.
Documentation: All functions must have clear docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.

Implementation and Refactoring

The original process_user_data function was refactored into refactored_data.py. The implementation followed the defined project rules, resulting in a more modular and robust solution. The process_user_data_refactored function now orchestrates the three new helper functions.

Conclusion

This workflow demonstrates how integrating AI (even simulated for planning) and adhering to clear project rules can lead to cleaner, more modular, and more robust code. Task decomposition, explicit error handling, and improved documentation are direct benefits of this structured approach.
